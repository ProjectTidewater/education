Disclaimer: This is a (very) rough draft and is subject to change.

PTE will issue its own coin. The quantity will be the same as Skycoin as will the price match Skycoins price. Probably will use Oracles to set the price. This will be the initial method for funding. Payment will be in Skycoin and the Skycoin used in the purchase will be only used for the educational tasks that the buyer of the PTE coins wants. If the Skycoins haven't been earned or at least claimed (Student is in the process of studying) by a student in a certain time the buyer of the PTE has the option to buy back their Skycoin in exchange for their PTE coins. When and if all the PTE coins have been bought up PTE coinholders will have the option to donate their coins back to keep PTE funded. Optionally they can donate Skycoin directly towards the Education tasks of their choice.
