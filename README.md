# Project Tidewater Education

Disclaimer: This is a (very) rough draft and is subject to change.

PTE will issue its own coin. The quantity will be the same as Skycoin as will the price match Skycoins price. Probably will use Oracles to set the price. This will be the initial method for funding. Payment will be in Skycoin and the Skycoin used in the purchase will be only used for the educational tasks that the buyer of the PTE coins wants. If the Skycoins haven't been earned or at least claimed (Student is in the process of studying) by a student in a certain time the buyer of the PTE has the option to buy back their Skycoin in exchange for their PTE coins. When and if all the PTE coins have been bought up PTE coinholders will have the option to donate their coins back to keep PTE funded. Optionally they can donate Skycoin directly towards the Education tasks of their choice.

THE ABOVE WILL BE DELETED LATER

Decided to go to in a different direction. Courses will be in a University format. 000 to 999 where 000 to 099 is high school level. 100 to 499 undergrad, 500 to 799 grad and 800 to 999 professional.

Courses, classes and tests will be created and maintained by the community not individuals. Therefore all skycoin goes to the students. Developers, coin contributers, node operators etc will make their money by investing in skycoin. This will ensure all do their best to provide a good product. May do some marketing such as, "buy 10 Skycoin and contribute 2". I believe the 8 will more than go up in value to cover the loss of the two

Thinking about using Moodle or another open source LMS to develop the courses. Courses can have the option to have prerequisites or substitutions. Also can have requirements or options to retake courses after a period of time or more advanced courses containing same material.

Pay for each course is dependent on course # times average factor voted upon by skycoin donaters. The more skycoin given the higher your vote counts.

Start out with one coin. As more people start participating can have different coins for subject, then course, then individual test if need be. Coins will be one to one in value with skycoin and created as needed. No set limit.

Students earn the one coin at the beginning but as the system grows they earn the coin of their course or even test. At first they can exchange them immediately for skycoin but with growth may have to earn so much, say at least 100 coins before exchanging to prevent bogging down the network. If less than the minimum amount is held there can be a minimum time also. Say for example 45 coins if held 3 months can be traded for skycoin. The network will be monitored and adjusted as needed. Coins can be exchanged within own subnet at will though. When exchanged for skycoin the coins will be burned out of existence.

As system grows, nodes can be divided randomly into subnets for subject, course, test etc. Node operators will make money by investing in skycoin and accumulating coinhours.

UPDATE#3
Going to go a different route again. No contributing Skycoin necessary. One million PTeD coins per year will be created or unlocked up to 100 years. Students will earn the coins based on the level of the test they pass and the number students taking/passing tests. Do the math and the early adopters can earn a lot of coins.

Probably will do a combination of proof of work (the tests) and proof of stake ( the amount of coins you hold plus how far you've advanced in your education) along with Obelisk. You earn more the further along you are so you risk losing your status if you do something malicious and have to start from the beginning. Mind you my understanding of the skycoin code is still in it's early stages and things will change as I progress.

Only will be one coin but multiple blockchains as the network grows. Pay will be determined by an algorithm based on course number and number of students to keep it at one million coins per year.

May let block makers and consensus nodes earn a percentage more than regular students. Everyone earns by taking tests and earning coinhours. Like I said, early adopters have the chance to earn a lot of coins.

Still hoping the best educators out there will contribute to and maintain the courses and tests so everyone out there can have a world class education and earn a living doing it.

Update#4
To keep things simple I think there will be only test questions. There's plenty of material to study from and the community can create support groups on the various platforms to help pass the tests. I believe a student should master a subject so a 95% grade will be required to pass and get paid. As far as the questions there should be at least 10 times the number of the questions on the test so a student doesn't get the same questions if they have to retake the test. There can be multiple layers to a test. What I mean is some questions might be more difficult than others so we want to have some kind of mapping so the student doesn't get all easy or all hard questions. As in school or certifications the tests can have prerequisites, other tests that can take its place or can be taken again after a certain length of time has passed. May even be a requirement to retake the test or more advanced one covering some of the same material.
There should be some kind of time limit to prevent students to just Google the answers but if the questions are good googling won't help.

Individuals, groups, educational institutions or others can have their own block chain of tests. How many tests depends on how many people are taking the tests. If the block chain starts getting slow, the easier tests will start getting disabled until the block chain speed stabilizes. The main block chain will allocate PTeD cryptocurrency base on the number of students taking the tests plus the number of total students plus the #level the tests are on.

The block chain and each test must be approved by holders of PTeD currency. They must hold enough such that it's not likely they will approve the tests so they can profit from taking the tests.
If there is some questions about the honesty of the block chain,the holders of PTeD can vote to disable it. It's probably best for each block chain of tests have a public face so there can be accountability. Not sure yet if I want to pay the block makers yet or just let them earn coinhours. If they do get a share, probably won't be more than one percent.

#update #5
Total revamp. Will leave testing up to educators/institutions. Anyone can join the system but must be approved by others already in the system. More info later
